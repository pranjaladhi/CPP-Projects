# Beam PDE Solver

Within this project, the main goal was to develop a program to solve a partial differential equation (PDE) for a beam under uniform load given user input. In addition while creating the program, another objective was to develop ideas on how to make the solver more efficient and implement a turbo mode to solve the PDE much faster. The equation for the beam is given as $EI(∂^2y/∂x^2) = -q/2(x^2-xL)$ where $L$ is the length of the beam, $q$ is the magnitude of the distributed load (per unit length), and $EI$ is the product of Young's modulus and cross-sectional moment of inertia which would all be input by the user. The program is to solve for $y(x)$ using the Gauss-Seidel iterative method to an l2 tolerance of 1e-8 and then compared with the analytic solution solved by using the 2nd order finitie-difference approximation by discretizing the beam into 5 equidistant points. The output of the program will state the number of iterations required to solve the PDE and state the l2 error compared with the analytic solution. Lastly, the amount of time elapsed will be output as well given the user's choice of number of points to discretize the beam by. All in all, this project allowed me to experience utilizng classes and the functions within while developing mathematical solvers for a given problem.
